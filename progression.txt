disarming trill

When you hit a creature with
a spell or weapon attack, you can expend one
inspiration die to attempt to disarm the target,
forcing it to drop one item of your choice that
it’s holding. You add the inspiration die to the
attack’s damage roll, and the target must make
a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it
drops the object you choose. The object lands at
its feet.

When you hit a creature

your bonus action to expend one inspiration die
to attempt to frighten the target. You add the
inspiration die to the attack’s damage roll, and
the target must make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the
end o f your next turn.

lyric of the lingering laggard

When you hit a
creature with a spell or weapon attack, you can
spend your bonus action to spend one
inspiration die to attempt to slow the creature’s
movement. The creature must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or have its movement
halved on the next move action it takes.

sonic riposte

When a creature misses you
with a melee attack, you can use your reaction
and expend one inspiration die to make a spell
attack against the creature’s AC. If you hit, you
do thunder damage equal to the result of
inspiration die roll plus your charisma modifier.
